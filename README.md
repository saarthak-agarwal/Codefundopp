## Our Approach

**Urban Regions:**

An app is developed where voters have to create an account to have their names on the voters’ list.
To create an account, the voter needs to upload three government-approved IDs:
 - Aadhar Card – for Fingerprint and Retina information related to the    cardholder 

 - PAN card /Ration card/ Passport   

 - Driving license/ Kisan Suraksha Card

The voters get 1 vote in the form of credit.
For **rural areas**, an official appointed by the Election Commission will have a special account in our app which would let the official create accounts for people who lack the facilities to create an account.

**Advantages of the app:**

We propose this method to remove the system of voter IDs. This way, we also tackle the problem of names missing from the voters’ list.
Three Government IDs are required and not just the Aadhar Card because Aadhar Cards of non-existent people are easily available in the black market.

People who turn 18 do not have to go through the tedious process for applying for Voter IDs, uploading followed by verification of three different kinds of government IDs is enough to get their names on the voters’ list.

**Features:**

 - The app has a decision helper; it has a list of promises made vs   
   promises kept, attendance in the house, criminal record, number of   
   debates participated in etc. 
   
 - The app translates into 22 languages.

 - For NRIs, the app can be used as a voting machine. Allowing
   them to vote from their phone directly. (With the restriction
   that the device should have a fingerprint scanner).
- Once the polling is over, the voters can view who they have    voted
   for. Hence, they can verify that their vote has been counted      
   and not tampered with, ensuring transparency and security.
 - Voters can  also view statistics related to votes from the city,
   district, and state.

  - After the close of poll, the results of the elections come on     the
   app within minutes as it is being updated each time a voter sends   
   a credit.

**Day of polling:**

People could choose their booth in order to cast their votes. This will prevent chaos and wastage of hours in long queues.

Government Banks, Schools, and other such institutions with the facility of computers and internet connection would be serving as polling stations across the country.

People would get a one-time QR Code on their apps which they scan at the polling stations to confirm their presence. The polling booth would have a computer with an on-screen animated guide in the voters’ preferred language as well as a voice-over, thereby guiding them through all the steps to prevent any human intervention; preventing any sorts of manipulation and also ensures the voters’ safety.

In order to prevent any mistakes from the voters’ side, the voters need to confirm their vote. First, they scan their fingerprints which are verified against their fingerprints in the Aadhar database, they then cast their vote. Next, they have to do an eye-scan, their retinas are matched against the ones stored in the Aadhar Database, once verified, they cast their vote again in order to confirm their vote.

**Use of Blockchain:**

Public blockchains lack complete privacy and anonymity leading to weaker security of the network and of the participant’s identity. Along with genuine contributors, at times the participants may also include the faulty ones who may be involved in malicious activities: hacking, token stealing, and network clogging.
The dangers of centralization that come with the use of PoW cannot be denied. Additionally, the public blockchain’s use of PoW requires a huge amount of computational power, therefore, an enormous amount of energy.

On the other hand, private blockchains have controlled participation in the network. The owner or operator has the rights to override, edit or delete the necessary entries on the blockchain as required.
Technically speaking, not everyone can run a full node on the private blockchain, make transactions, or validate the changes.

With permissioned blockchains, the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected list of participants. Users can’t join without permission.
Yes, within these kinds of blockchain networks, the participants are typically known but with our architecture, the names and the choices they make would be encrypted to prevent any kind of identity leaks.

The vote which is given to the voters in the form of a credit, once cast, is sent to the Voted party’s account.

Once the polling is over, the party with maximum credits is declared as the winner. Voters can also send their credits to the NOTA account. If NOTA credits exceed 1/3 of the votes, no absolute winner is declared.
